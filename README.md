<h1>CS-260_Project</h1>
<h2>The entirety of my Scrum/Agile project from CS-260, Software Development Lifecycles</h2>
<p>
This is a retrospective of my entire project in CS-260, Software Development Lifecycles. During this project, I took on the role of a Scrum Master, a Product Owner, and a member of the Development/Testing team. As each member of the Scrum team I worked my way through each of the stages of the Agile method of software development. The end product was for a fictional web company, "SNHU Travel", and was developed over the course of six weeks. 
  
For a full summary of the project, please open and review the Spring Retrospective document. The final product is contained within the .jar files in this repository. Journal documents recount the responsibities I took on within each role for the project, starting with the Scrum Master.
