<h1>CS-260_Project</h1>
<h2>The entirety of my Scrum/Agile project from CS-260, Software Development Lifecycles</h2>
<p>
This is a retrospective of my entire project in CS-260, Software Development Lifecycles. During this project, I took on the role of a Scrum Master, a Product Owner, and a member of the Development/Testing team. As each member of the Scrum team I worked my way through each of the stages of the Agile method of software development. The end product was for a fictional web company, "SNHU Travel", and was developed over the course of six weeks. 
  
For a full summary of the project, please open and review the <a href="https://github.com/lorenarms/CS-260_Project/blob/c47d7394708f68eac333eee2ef20a14b8e6b238d/Final%20Project%20FInal%20Draft.docx">Sprint Retrospective</a> document. The final product is contained within the .jar files in this repository. Journal documents recount the responsibities I took on within each role for the project, starting with the Scrum Master.

Some things I learned during this project were how to interpret user needs and implement them into the final product. By closely studying the user stories that are created based on market research and focus groups, I can create an experience that not only appeals to the average user, but also fulfills their needs within the application. When developing these applications, it's important for me to understand not just the user's needs, but how they will interact with the finished application. Creating an intuitive and easily navigable user interface is just as important and developing loosely couple code.

All of these tasks are important, and the bigger the project the bigger the team needs to be. Working with a team means constant open communication. Being able to provide not only constructive criticisms, but also solutions to problems is of great importance. Being supportive of your team keeps things running smoothly, and maintains a positive work environment where everyone feels valued and no one is made to feel inadequate or less useful. Good team members work closely with one another and value each other's opinions. After all, it will take the whole team working together to create a complex and polished final application.
